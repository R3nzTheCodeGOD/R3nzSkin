# **R3nzSkin**

## Announcement

### Have you account been banned?

Riot has [implemented](https://twitter.com/RiotK3o/status/1682122977050238980) a new system to detect and ban botted accounts. If your account was leveled with a BOT within the last years time and it got banned, it was because of this new system, **NOT** because of R3nzSkin.

I am currently continuing my military service, and as the place where I am serving is a border region, updates may be delayed or may not arrive.

`R3nzSkin` is an internal skin changer for League of Legends.

</div>

-   Change the skin of your champion, your ward, other champions, towers, minions, and jungle monsters in the game.
-   Automatic skin database update.
-   Support for spectator mode.
-   Change skins anytime and unlimited times in a single game.
-   Supports all popular languages ​​in the world.
-   In-game configuration with <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">ImGui</a>.
-   <a href="https://github.com/nlohmann/json">JSON</a> based configuration saving & loading

# Building

1. Clone the source with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/R3nzTheCodeGOD/R3nzSkin.git`
2. Build in Visual Studio 2019/2022 with configuration "Your Region - x64"

# Usage

1. Compile source or <a href="https://github.com/R3nzTheCodeGOD/R3nzSkin/releases/latest">download</a> a compiled version.
2. Use `R3nzSkin_Injector.exe` or inject the built DLL into the game yourself.
    - _Administrator_ privilege may be needed if the injector failed to inject the DLL.
    - League client can crash if `R3nzSkin` is injected before being in the game.
        - A workaround is to not inject until you are in the game (you will need to be fast to not disrupt the game).
3. Press <kbd>Insert</kbd> to bring up the menu.
4. Select the skin for you, your teammates, enemies, and wards.

# Further optimizations

If your CPU supports AVX / AVX2 / AVX-512 instruction set, you can enable it in project settings. This should result in more performant code, optimized for your CPU. Currently SSE2 instructions are selected in project settings.
